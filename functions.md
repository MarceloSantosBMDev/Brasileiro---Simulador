Here I will write about the functions of the app, I will try don´t talk about the code, only functions of it.
# Edition select
Before the simulation starts, the user must choose the year of the championship, until now, have only two options, 2024 and 2025, I will add some more editions for it, the choose of the user go definy the teams is going to play in the simulation.
The 2025 edition, don´t have a correct accurace in stats, because the real championship don´t started yet, that´s why I don´t know the real teams situations yet, but I had balanced in relation of the nacional championships of each team like 'Campeonato Paulista', 'Campeonato Mineiro', 'Campeonato Carioca'..., just know, I think the simulation don´t will be so much precisely.

# Round Simulation
This is the button of the system responsable for simulate each round, every time this button is pressed, one round is simulated, you can press this only 38 times because this is the number of rounds of the real championship. After the championship is finish, the button will change for Championship information, I will talk about this after.

# Open the games screen
Below the round simulation button, there is a button that opens the games screen. On this screen, the user can select a team to view each of its matches. The games screen also displays some information about the selected team, such as the number of home wins, home losses, total matches played, and its current position in the standings.

# Open Config screen
In rigth top of the screen, the user can open the settings of the app, Over there, the user can make somethings that before the user could change in the code, after the 1.0.2, this button is add for the user can change stats of each team with the code closed. The user can make other things too, but it I will talk about after.

# Languege
Actually, now, the code don´t have tbis function, today is february 17th 2025, and the last realese is the version 1.0.3, but the version 1.0.4 is so close, I´m just ending some details. About the function, look, now, if the user don´t speek portuguese, the user can translate the app for english, or if he want, of germany, Until now, the app just have 3 languages, english, portuguese and germany, but, in the future, new language will be add.

# Random All Stats
In settings, the user can also randomize all stats of each teams, it´s very simple, just one click and all teams have them stats randomize.
