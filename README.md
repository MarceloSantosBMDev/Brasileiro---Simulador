## üìù About the Project

This project is a **Brazil Soccer Championship Simulator** with some interesting features:

- Each team has a number representing its **goal chances**.  
- **Goal chance does not guarantee a goal**, it just represents the possibility of scoring.  
- The function `Simular_Jogo` places the team in a goal situation, and a **30% random chance** decides if the goal is scored.  
  - If `True` ‚Üí team scores a goal.  
  - If `False` ‚Üí the team misses the goal.  
- Supports **three languages**: English, Portuguese, and German.  
  - To change the language, just go to **Settings** and choose your desired language.
